## Design Appraoch
  * Started with Distance model which will calculate the distance between two given coordinates
  * Methods
   - change_in_latitude
   - change_in_longitude
   - latitude_in_radians
   - longitude_in_radians
   - cosine_of_latitude_one
   - cosine_of_latitude_two
   - Haversine angle
   - Design change: Changed the class name to HaversineAngle (was Distance)
   - added c variable model class with appropriate methods
   - Using class inheritance, may switch to modules
   - Added distance model class

   - CSV parser (New model Earthquake list attributes)
   - CSV only reads headers that match attributes
